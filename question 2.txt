<!-- Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading "HTML defines th: content and structure of
your website” on th: web browser? -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- <comment>This is heading tag</comment> it is not supported in modern browser -->
     <H1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</H1>
